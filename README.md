## What is it?

When a friend requested me to write an imitation of the [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) Service Monitor, I decided I wanted to write something that would be generally useful and flexible. With Aestan Tray Menu, you can create your own tray menu with access to all sorts of applications, documents and services. AeTrayMenu is open-source.

### What does it do?

AeTrayMenu puts a tray icon in your system tray. When you click on it with your left or right mouse button, a popup menu will appear. The menus that appear are fully configurable.
